**Weight:** 1  
**Project Duration:** Nov 10, 2025 – Nov 17, 2025  
**Status:** Project Over  
**Score:** 0.0/30 mandatory (Final Score: 0.0%)

---

## 📖 Overview
This project dives into the world of **control flow** and **loops**, essential concepts for introducing logic into your Python programs. You’ll learn how to make decisions using conditional statements and automate repetitive tasks using loops.

By mastering these fundamentals, you’ll be able to write more **dynamic**, **efficient**, and **readable** Python code.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- **Control Flow Basics**
  - Explain the concept of control flow and its role in programming.
  - Utilize conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`) to control the flow of execution.
  - Write practical examples demonstrating decision-making with conditional statements.

- **Match Case (Python 3.10+)**
  - Understand the concept of `match case` statements as an alternative to multiple `if/elif`.
  - Explain the advantages of `match case` for handling multiple conditions.
  - Implement `match case` with proper syntax, including matching against specific values and types.
  - Apply best practices to enhance code readability and efficiency.

- **Looping Constructs**
  - Grasp the purpose and different types of loops available in Python.
  - Utilize `for` loops to iterate over sequences (lists, tuples, strings, ranges).
  - Write examples demonstrating iteration over various data structures.
  - Explain the concept of `while` loops and how they differ from `for` loops.
  - Implement `while` loops to execute code repeatedly as long as a condition remains true.
  - Understand **nested loops** (loops within loops) and their applications in scenarios like:
    - Working with multidimensional data
    - Creating patterns

## 🛠️ Skills You’ll Gain
- Writing **clean and concise code** using control flow.
- Automating repetitive tasks with **loops**.
- Improving **code readability** with `match case`.
- Applying **best practices** for decision-making and iteration.

## 📂 Example Topics Covered
- Conditional Statements:
  ```python
  age = 18
  if age >= 18:
      print("You are an adult.")
  else:
      print("You are a minor.")
