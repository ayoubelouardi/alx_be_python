## 📝 In a Nutshell
This project explores the **fundamentals of Python programming** through functions, data structures, and modules. You’ll learn how to define and use functions, manage data effectively with built-in structures, and extend Python’s capabilities using modules and libraries.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

### 🔹 Functions
- Define the purpose and importance of functions in Python programming.
- Construct functions using `def` and `lambda` keywords with proper syntax.
- Work with function parameters, argument passing mechanisms, default values, and keyword arguments.
- Explain and use return values effectively with the `return` statement.
- Distinguish between local and global variable scope.
- Apply `global` and `nonlocal` keywords appropriately to manage variable scope.

### 🔹 Data Structures
- Identify common Python data structures: **Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries**.
- Select the appropriate data structure based on data type and operations.
- Perform operations on Lists (indexing, slicing, appending, etc.).
- Utilize Dictionary methods, understand the immutability of Tuples, and perform Set operations.

### 🔹 Modules and Libraries
- Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python.
- Create and use custom modules.
- Import and use standard modules provided by Python.
- Install and use external libraries with `pip`.
- Identify essential Python libraries and their functionalities (e.g., `requests`).

### 🔹 Scope and Namespaces
- Comprehend the **LEGB rule** (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in) for variable lookup.
- Implement best practices for effective variable scope management.
- Explain the concept of namespaces and differentiate between their types.
- Describe the lifecycle of a namespace and how scope resolution works in Python.

## 🛠️ Skills Gained
- Writing clean, maintainable, and reusable Python code.
- Managing data effectively with built-in structures.
- Extending Python functionality with modules and libraries.
- Understanding scope, namespaces, and variable resolution.
