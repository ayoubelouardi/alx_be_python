## 🎯 Project Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the core concepts of OOP: **classes, objects, encapsulation, and abstraction**.
- Discuss the significance of OOP in software development and its advantages over other programming paradigms.
- Define classes and create objects in Python.
- Understand the difference between **class attributes, instance methods**, and the role of the **self** keyword within classes.
- Differentiate between **syntax errors** and **exceptions** in Python.
- Identify common Python exceptions and understand their causes.
- Utilize **try, except, else, and finally** blocks to handle exceptions effectively.
- Raise exceptions using the **raise** keyword and create **custom exceptions** for specific errors in your code.
- Explain the importance of **testing** in software development.
- Describe different types of testing, with a focus on **unit testing**.
- Write basic unit tests using Python’s **unittest** module to verify the functionality of your code.
